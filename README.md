## Azure Functions durable task scheduler

The durable task scheduler is a solution for durable execution in Azure. Durable execution is a fault-tolerant approach to running code that handles failures and interruptions through automatic retries and state persistence. Scenarios where durable execution is required include distributed transactions, multi-agent orchestration, data processing, infrastructure management, and others. Coupled with a developer orchestration framework like Durable Functions or the Durable Task SDKs, the durable task scheduler enables developers to author stateful apps that run on any compute environment without the need to architect for fault tolerance. 

Developers can use the durable task scheduler with the following orchestration frameworks: 
- [Durable Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview) 
- Durable Task SDKs, also referred to as "portable SDKs"

> **Note:** Though the durable task scheduler can also be used with the [Durable Task Framework](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask), we recommend new apps to use the Durable Task SDK over the Durable Task Framework as the former follows more modern .NET conventions and will be the focus of our future investments.

### Use with Durable Functions 
When used with Durable Functions, a feature of Azure Functions, the durable task scheduler plays the role the ["backend provider"](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-storage-providers), where state data is persisted as the app runs. While other backend providers are supported, only the durable task scheduler offers a fully managed experience, which removes operational overhead from users. Additionally, the scheduler offers exceptional performance, reliability, and the ease of monitoring orchestrations. 

### Use with Durable Task SDKs or "portable SDKs"
The Durable Task SDKs provide a lightweight client library for the durable task scheduler. When running orchestrations, apps using these SDKs would make a connection to the scheduler's orchestration engine in Azure. These SDKs are called "portable" because apps that leverage them can be hosted in various compute environments, such as Azure Container Apps, Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure App Service, or VMs.

## Tools

### loadtest CLI

A lightweight load-testing CLI for stress-testing HTTP endpoints — including Durable Task Scheduler orchestration endpoints. It supports constant, ramp-up, and spike load scenarios and reports throughput, latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99), and error rates in the terminal or as JSON/CSV exports.

```bash
# Quick start
npx loadtest run --url https://api.example.com/start --vus 50 --duration 30s
```

See [`loadtest/README.md`](./loadtest/README.md) for full documentation, CLI flags, and examples.
